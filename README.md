Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

    Software engineering is a disciplined approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications.
    The importance of Software Engineering: 
    1. ensure qulity and reliability
    2. scalability 
    3. Cost efficiency

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

    1. structured programming- introduction to a systematic way of writing code. 
    2. Object-orientated Programming- Enabled modular, reusable, and scalable software development through concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance.
    3. Agile and DevOps - Enhanced software development efficinecy by promoting iterative development

 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    1. Planning- Defining the project golas and reqirements
    2. Analysis- Analyzing the requiremnts and understanding whats required. 
    3. Design- create system structure and designing the user interface. 
    4. Implementation- Coding and developing the system 
    5. Testing- testing the system and finding and fixing errors/bugs 
    6. Deployment- Release software
    7. Maintainace- Update and improve software


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

    Waterfall Method Development approach is linear and sequential and Agile Method is iterative and flexible. The project phases of the Agile method are Sprints and continuous delivery, the waterfall method is fixed phases. Agile method is fater and the waterfall is slower.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

    Software Developer - writes and maintains code for software applications
    Software Developer Responsibilites:
        1. Develops and implements software based on requirements 
        2. Write clean, efficient and maintainable code
    
    Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures that the software meets the quality standards
    Quality Assurance Responsibilties:
     1. Develops and uses test plans, cases and scripts
     2. tracks and documents bugs 
     3. conducts tests 

    Project Manager- Overseas project planning, execution and delivery 
    Project Manager Responsibilites:
        1. Defines project scope, goals and timelines
        2. Mnages resources, budgets and risks

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

    IDE - enchances productivity by providing one environment for coding, testing, debugging and managing. example, VS Code, Pycharm. 

    VCS- essential for tracking changes and improves collaboration and prevents data loss. Example of version control, GIT,GITHUB. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Keeping up with the latest technology- Developers should be in the loop and always be willing to learn about the new tech that is being introduced always. 
2. debugging complex issues - collaborating with seniors and different people could help in debugging easier.
3. changing requirements - make sure they make the client understand the other possible features they think could work to reduce feature creeping. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    
    Unit Testing - tests individual units of the software separate.
    importance: 
        1. makes sure all units are functioning correctly in the system.
    
    Integration testing - tests how different units work together 
    importance:
        1. Get to see issue with data flow , interactions.
    
    System testing- tests the entire system
    importance:
        1. Ensures the software functions correctly

    Acceptance testing -  Validates the software against business requirements to determine if it meets user needs.
    importance:
        1. Confirms that the product is ready for deployment and satisfies customer expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to optimize responses.
    Its importance is that it enchances AI Accurancy, improves and efficiency and productivity. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "tell me about Ai"
Improved: Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the software development industry, including benefits and challenges."

its more effective cause it decreases time spent trying to find a answer and it provides clarity and no umabiguity.
